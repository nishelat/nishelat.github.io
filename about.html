			<div class="educationHeader"></div>I am extremely grateful to have a loving family and supportive friends, all of whom celebrate who I am. One of my greatest wishes is that no one will ever have to face the fear of being rejected by the people they love because they are different.<br><br>
			I am an active member of Queers in Engineering, Science, and Technology at USC and participated in MSJ Gay-Straight Alliance in high school. These organizations, though small, are important to me and many others because they strengthen the bond between the gay community and its allies.

			I wrote the JavaScript algorithms and designed the JSON file for this Google Chrome extension which fights online harassment by censoring derogatory YouTube comments. It dynamically accesses each page every quarter of a second and searches comments for specific words which are considered malicious, and then deletes the bad comments.<br><br>
