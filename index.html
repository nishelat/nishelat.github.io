			Hello! My name is Nishir Shelat, and I am a Computer Engineering and Computer Science student at the University of Southern California. When I started coding in high school, I found that I really enjoyed designing and creating things from start to finish. I love every part of development, from back-end to front-end. I’ve learned to appreciate the power of code and the ways it can make our lives better. I am always expanding my skills by learning new languages and working on new platforms. If you have a project that you think I could help you with, or a problem to throw at me, or just want to discuss my work, please don’t hesitate to contact me <a href="contact.html">here!</a>
