			<u>HackTube &#9679; SBHacks 2017 &#9679; 2nd Best Overall, Best Hack Against Harassment</u><br>
			~ Featured as a "Staff Pick" on Devpost ~<br><br>
			HackTube is a Google Chrome extension which fights online harassment by censoring derogatory YouTube comments. I wrote the JavaScript algorithms for the extension, which dynamically accesses each page every quarter of a second and searches comments for specific words which are considered malicious, and then deletes the bad comments. I also initialized and formatted the JSON file.<br><br><br>
			<img src="images/projectIcons/succinct.png">
			<u>Succinct &#9679; HackUCI 2017 &#9679; Organizer's Choice Award</u><br><br>
			Succinct is a web app which turns essays into visual presentations. It uses the Google Cloud Natural Language Processing API to find the main ideas of an essay, and then uses the Flickr API to find matching photos. It then composes a slideshow about the essay using both the photos and the extracted main ideas. I led the backend members of my team and implemented Flickr's photosearch API using PHP.<br><br><br>
			<img src="images/projectIcons/studybuddy.png">
			<u>Study Buddy &#9679; TrojanHacks 2016 &#9679; Best Visual Media</u><br><br>
			Study Buddy is a Google Chrome extension which boosts productivity by setting timers that record how long the user spends working versus surfing the Internet. I used cookies to implement cross-tab functionality and JavaScript to create two timers which activate based on user activity.

			<img src="images/projectIcons/hellomundo.png">
			<u>Hello Mundo &#9679; HackPoly 2017</u><br><br>
			Hello Mundo is a web app which follows the user's face and generates a floating speech bubble next to their head. It listens to what they say, translates it to another language in real-time, and displays the results in the speech bubble. It can translate from many different languages to English, and vice-versa. I integrated the computer vision capability using trackingJS and programmed the speech bubble to follow the user's face. I also developed the JavaScript code which transforms translated text into speech using translateJS.<br><br><br><br>
			<img src="images/projectIcons/travelyze.png">
			<u>Travelyze &#9679; CalHacks 2016</u><br><br>
			Travelyze is a web app which assists travelers by displaying airline ticket prices for the upcoming year in an interactive graph. I led the frontend members of my team; designed and developed all of the JavaScript visual effects, and also built the home page of the site from scratch using HTML/CSS.<br><br><br><br>
			<video src="images/projectIcons/makers.mp4" autoplay loop muted></video>
			<u>Official Website &#9679; Makers at USC 2017</u><br><br>
			As Director of Marketing, I was tasked with constructing a website for Makers at USC from scratch. I designed and developed this website using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. It is responsive and has a mobile version so that it can be accessed easily across devices. Visit the site <b><a href="http://makers-usc.github.io">here</a></b>.<br><br><br><br>
			<img src="images/projectIcons/mirror.jpg">
			<u>Magic Mirror &#9679; Makers at USC 2016</u><br><br>
			Magic Mirror is a smart mirror that my friend and I created using a TV monitor, a two-way mirror, and a Raspberry Pi connected to an Apache webserver. It can display the time and weather using the Yahoo API. I helped construct the mirror and its frame, which is made out of wood. I also initialized and formatted the HTML/CSS for the page which the mirror displays.<br><br><br><br>
			<img src="images/projectIcons/speedtrap.jpg">
			<u>Speed Trap &#9679; Intro to Embedded Systems at USC 2016</u><br><br>
			Speed Trap is a device which measures how fast an object is moving as it passes two sensors and then relays that speed to a remote device. I built the circuit using an Arduino Uno, breadboard, LED screen, and phototransistors; enabled the transfer of bits to a remote device using a TTL/RS-232 converter; and implemented a rotary encoder and speaker and programmed the entire device in C.<br><br><br>
