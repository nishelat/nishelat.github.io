It features a countdown clock which records how much time the user has left to study, as well as a second clock which only runs when the user in on a website that is distracting to them. The user inputs a list of websites to be "blacklisted" and marked as distracting. When either timer runs out, a random GIF is shown to the user which either congratulates them for working hard or criticizes them for wasting to much time.</div>

				<div id="journaltext"><b>Journal (C++)</b> - Click <a href="https://github.com/nishelat/Journal">here</a> to see this project on GitHub!<br><br>I created a password-protected, encrypted journal with C++ that can be operated from the command terminal. It uses file I/O to read and write user entries. I am currently working on adding more functions to my program, such as spell-checking, multiple-user capability, and time-sensitive reading windows.</div>

				<div id="battlegametext"><b>Battle Game (C++)</b> - Click <a href="https://github.com/nishelat/Island-RPG">here</a> to see this project on GitHub!<br><br>I created a turn-based text game that can be operated from the command terminal. It allows users to create accounts and records the time passed since they last logged in. It uses text templates to populate the world with monsters that the player can battle for gold and glory. So far, I have plans to improve the game by adding more enemies and locations so that the player can feel immersed. I am also planning to create a user-interface so that it doesn't have to be operated from the command terminal.</div>

It combines the power of Amadeusâ€™ Extensive Flight Search with the elegance of the Google Maps API to provide you with important information about flight prices. It displays the information in an interactive, visually-pleasing graph which was created using the Plotly API. This project was created at CalHacks 3.0.</div>
